Source of Dataset:Kaggle<br/>
Data shape: 70000*13<br/>

# Features:
        id                          :id of the patient 
        Age                         :age of the patient in days
        Gender                      :Male or Female
        Height                      :Height in cm
        Weight                      :in K.G.
        Systolic Blood Pressure     :
        Diastolic Blood Pressure    :
        Cholesterol                 :Low,Normal,High
        Glucose Level               :Low,Normal,High
        Smoke                       :Does the patient smoke
        Alcohol                     :Does the patient consume alcohol
        Active                      :is he/she physically active
# Target Variable 
        Cardio                      :if the person has Cardio Vascular disease or not
        
        
# Applied Algorithms:
    Support Vector Machine
    Random Forest
    Gaussian Naive Bayes

Among all these Random Forest gave the highest prediction rate of 96% for training dataset and 92% for testing dataset. So Random Forest is used to predict the answer in web form.
